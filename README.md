In this repository, I have demonstrated some scenarios in Android automation like:
- Installing and opening Appliactions. Interacting with existing application with installing it.
- Unlocking a device locked with PIN.
- Autogranting permissions to apps, Activating & terminating apps, uninstalling apps
- Keyboard interactions
- Custom method to perform complex gesture actions like  swipe left/right/top/bottom,zoom in/out, drag & drop, tap, long tap etc
- Automated setting alarm in Google Clock App.
